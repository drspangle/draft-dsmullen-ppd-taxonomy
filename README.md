Use this repository for the draft source, local render workflow, and local
working notes for this draft only.

## Workstation Bootstrap

This repository owns its own draft-render setup. Bootstrap it with:

```sh
python3 scripts/setup_draft_workstation.py bootstrap
```

There is intentionally no shared workspace bootstrap. This bootstrap configures
only this repository.

If you are preparing for Datatracker submission, bootstrap the submission
toolchain too:

```sh
python3 scripts/setup_draft_workstation.py bootstrap --submission-tools
```

That native path keeps the Node/npm dependency repo-local under `.tooling/`
when `npm` is not already installed on the workstation.

Validation steps for this repository are in [WORKSTATION-VALIDATION.md](WORKSTATION-VALIDATION.md).

## Start Here

1. Bootstrap the local render workflow with `python3 scripts/setup_draft_workstation.py bootstrap`.
2. If you intend to run pre-submit checks, bootstrap the native submission toolchain with `python3 scripts/setup_draft_workstation.py bootstrap --submission-tools`.
3. Validate the local setup with [WORKSTATION-VALIDATION.md](WORKSTATION-VALIDATION.md).
4. Build the draft with `make`.
5. Run `python3 scripts/setup_draft_workstation.py validate-submission` before final submission work.
6. Use [internal-notes/README.md](internal-notes/README.md) for local working notes.

On Windows, prefer native POSIX tooling when available. Use WSL only as an
explicit fallback:

```powershell
py -3 scripts\setup_draft_workstation.py bootstrap --use-wsl --install-wsl-deps
```

## Command Line Usage

Formatted text and HTML versions of the draft can be built using `make`.

```sh
$ make
```

Command line usage requires that you have the necessary software installed.  See
[the instructions](https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template/blob/main/doc/SETUP.md).

To exercise the pre-submit path that generates the next versioned XML and runs
`idnits`, use:

```sh
$ python3 scripts/setup_draft_workstation.py validate-submission
```
