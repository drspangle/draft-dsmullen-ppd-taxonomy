                Privacy Preference Declaration Taxonomy
                   draft-dsmullen-ppd-taxonomy-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a standardized taxonomy for describing data
   handling practices of Internet-connected devices within home
   networks.  It complements the Privacy Preference Declaration (PPD)
   Protocol by providing the necessary vocabulary and semantic structure
   to represent and reason about data types, purposes, actions, sources,
   and destinations.  This taxonomy supports both machine reasoning and
   human interpretation and can be implemented using ontological
   frameworks such as OWL-DL.

1.  Introduction

   The effectiveness of the Privacy Preference Declaration (PPD)
   architecture depends on a shared understanding of the semantics of
   privacy preferences.  (TODO: reference the main architecture i-d
   here.)  A well-structured taxonomy enables the clear articulation of
   user-defined privacy constraints and provides a common language for
   devices to report their data handling practices.

   This document introduces such a taxonomy, allowing policy
   declarations to express what kind of data is being handled, why it is
   being handled, how it is used, where it originates and is sent, and
   who is involved.  These taxonomic categories enable reasoning over
   complex privacy configurations and enforceable policies.

   To support interoperability and consistency, the taxonomy defined
   herein is coupled with a centralized registry governed by IANA or a
   designated authority.  This registry ensures that all terms used in
   privacy declarations are semantically defined, unambiguous, and
   maintained through a community-driven process.  The registry plays a
   critical role in policy validation, enforcement logic, and device
   interoperability across ecosystems.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Design Goals

   *  Semantic Clarity: Enable precise and unambiguous expression of
      privacy concepts.

   *  Machine Reasoning: Support ontology-based reasoning to detect
      policy violations or mismatches.

   *  Extensibility: Allow addition of new concepts without disrupting
      existing deployments.

   *  Alignment: Reflect terminology familiar from privacy regulations
      (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

   *  Registry Governance: Ensure terms are publicly documented,
      versioned, and governed through a formal review process to
      maintain ecosystem coherence.

   *  Validation Support: Facilitate automated validation of policies
      and declarations using machine-readable registry definitions.

   *  Interoperability: Promote uniform understanding of privacy
      semantics across diverse vendors and devices, backed by a shared
      taxonomy registry.

4.  Core Taxonomy Structure

   The taxonomy consists of five orthogonal but interrelated categories.
   These categories reference the concepts defined by Contextual
   Integrity theory in describing data flows.  (TODO: cite this properly
   as an informative reference)

4.1.  Data Type (What)

   Defines the nature of the data being collected, used, or transmitted.

   Examples:

   *  temperatureReading

   *  videoCapture

   *  locationCoordinate

   *  audioTranscript

   *  deviceIdentifier

   *  healthStatus

   This dimension aligns with data classification in privacy laws and
   informs sensitivity.

4.2.  Purpose (Why)

   Describes the rationale for processing the data.

   Examples:

   *  coreFunctionality (e.g., heating control)

   *  analytics

   *  advertising

   *  securityMonitoring

   *  personalization

   *  diagnostics

   Each purpose can be mapped to categories of lawful basis for
   processing under regulations like GDPR (e.g., contract, consent,
   legitimateInterest).

4.3.  Action (How)

   Specifies what is being done with the data.

   Subclasses:

   *  collection (retrieval or ingestion)

   *  usage (processing or decision-making)

   *  transfer (sharing externally)

   *  retention (storage over time)

   *  deletion (erasure procedures)

   These actions enable both auditing and fine-grained controls.

4.4.  Source and Destination (Where and To Whom)

   Defines the data origin and endpoint.

   Source may be, in the abstract:

   *  userInput

   *  sensor

   *  inferred (e.g., derived from other data)

   *  thirdPartyImport

   Destination may include, in the abstract:

   *  localProcessing

   *  cloudStorage

   *  manufacturerServer

   *  thirdPartyPartner

   *  dataBroker

   Concrete examples of these abstract categories of source and
   destination may also be used, such as [RFC3986].  This classification
   enables constraints on data flow (e.g., local-only, no third-party
   sharing).

5.  Ontological Representation

   To support semantic reasoning, the taxonomy is expressed in OWL-DL
   (Web Ontology Language - Description Logic).  (TODO: perhaps add a
   normative reference to this?)  This allows:

   *  Inference of non-compliance: e.g., if a device claims to process
      only temperatureReading for coreFunctionality, but attempts to
      collect locationCoordinate for advertising.

   *  Subclassing and equivalence: Allowing extension through subClassOf
      and equivalentClass definitions.

   *  Integration with existing vocabularies: Such as Data Privacy
      Vocabulary (DPV), and schema.org.  (TODO: add an informative
      reference to DPV)

5.1.  Example OWL Classes

   <owl:Class rdf:ID="DataType"/>
   <owl:Class rdf:ID="temperatureReading">
     <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#DataType"/>
   </owl:Class>

   <owl:Class rdf:ID="Purpose"/>
   <owl:Class rdf:ID="coreFunctionality">
     <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#Purpose"/>
   </owl:Class>

   <owl:ObjectProperty rdf:ID="hasPurpose">
     <rdfs:domain rdf:resource="#DataHandlingAction"/>
     <rdfs:range rdf:resource="#Purpose"/>
   </owl:ObjectProperty>

6.  Use in Privacy Policies

   Policies referencing this taxonomy can be expressed in a structured
   format such as JSON-LD or RDF/XML, allowing for both enforcement at
   runtime and static policy analysis.  (TODO: add normative references
   here)

6.1.  Sample Policy Statement (JSON-LD)

   {
     "@context": "http://example.org/ppd-taxonomy",
     "@type": "Policy",
     "appliesTo": "device:smart-thermostat-123",
     "allows": {
       "action": "collection",
       "data": "temperatureReading",
       "purpose": "coreFunctionality",
       "destination": "localProcessing"
     },
     "prohibits": [
       {
         "action": "transfer",
         "data": "temperatureReading",
         "destination": "thirdPartyPartner"
       },
       {
         "action": "collection",
         "data": "locationCoordinate"
       }
     ]
   }

7.  Security Considerations

7.1.  Tamper resistance

   Devices must not forge or misrepresent declared purposes.  Term
   identifiers MAY include cryptographic hashes for integrity.  All
   entries MUST be tamper-resistant and digitally signed where
   applicable.  Devices SHALL reject policies using unrecognized or
   invalid terms.

7.2.  Immutable references

   Policy enforcement relies on exact matching; hash-based identifiers
   may be used.

7.3.  Cross-device reasoning

   Shared taxonomy supports detecting conflicts or inconsistencies in
   multi-device settings.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This specification requests the creation of a new IANA registry
   titled:

   Privacy Preference Declaration (PPD) Taxonomy Registry

   This registry defines structured terms for use in Privacy Preference
   Declarations, organized across five core categories: DataType,
   Purpose, Action, Source, and Destination.  It is intended to support
   semantic validation, enforcement, and interoperability in privacy-
   aware networked systems.

8.1.  Purpose and Justification

   The Privacy Taxonomy Registry described in this document serves as
   the authoritative catalog of privacy-related semantic terms used
   across the Privacy Preference Declaration (PPD) architecture.
   Managed under the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), this
   registry provides a consistent, governed vocabulary to ensure
   interoperability, enforcement, and semantic alignment among privacy
   declarations, devices, and policy engines.

   Unlike many traditional IANA registries that define protocol-level
   constructs such as status codes or media types, the Privacy Taxonomy
   Registry defines semantically rich terms suitable for reasoning over
   privacy constraints.  Each term is designed to be both human-readable
   and machine-processable, enabling automated policy enforcement,
   auditing, and semantic validation in distributed environments like
   home networks.  The registry helps prevent semantic drift, ensures
   privacy declarations are interpretable across vendor ecosystems, and
   provides a compliance anchor point for policy analysis and device
   certification.  It supports a unified approach to policy expression
   that is extensible yet constrained by formal definitions, such as
   those expressed in OWL-DL.  This registry distinguishes itself by
   supporting semantic reasoning and structured validation, not just
   name-value mappings.  It is foundational to privacy-preserving
   automation.

8.2.  Registry and Extension Mechanism

   The success of the Privacy Preference Declaration framework depends
   on a shared, extensible, and authoritative vocabulary of privacy-
   related concepts.  A unified taxonomy ensures that:

   *  Users can write meaningful, enforceable policies with well-
      understood terms.

   *  Device manufacturers can interpret and comply with these policies
      using standard semantics.

   *  Policy processing engines can reason over device declarations and
      user constraints for compatibility, conflicts, or enforcement.

   Without a centralized governance model, the ecosystem risks semantic
   drift — where different devices interpret similar terms differently,
   or invent new, incompatible terms — undermining both interoperability
   and policy clarity.

8.2.1.  Taxonomy Registry

   A central Privacy Taxonomy Registry SHALL be established and governed
   by a standards organization (e.g., IETF/IANA, or an independent
   Privacy Policy Consortium).  This registry SHALL:

   *  Host the canonical definitions for core taxonomy terms.

   *  Publish OWL-DL and JSON-LD serializations for tooling.

   *  Allow versioning and deprecation of terms.

   *  Accept vetted community-submitted extensions via a structured
      process.

   *  Provide a human-readable portal and machine-readable API for
      lookup and validation.

8.3.  Registry Structure

   Each entry in the registry MUST include the following fields:

   *  term_id: Globally unique identifier (e.g., ppd:purpose.analytics,
      ppd:dataType.temperature)

   *  category: One of: DataType, Purpose, Action, Source, Destination

   *  definition: Human-readable description of the term

   *  owl_definition: OWL-DL class or property definition

   *  examples: At least one real-world usage scenario

   *  status: Enum: active, deprecated, or experimental

   *  submitted_by: Name of contributing entity (organization or
      individual)

   *  date_registered: ISO timestamp of official inclusion

   *  version: Semantic versioning identifier (e.g., 1.0.0)

   *  references: Optional legal or technical citations (e.g., GDPR,
      RFCs)

   All entries MUST conform to this structure and be encoded in both
   machine-readable (JSON-LD, RDF/XML) and human-readable formats.

8.4.  Initial Registry Contents

   IANA SHALL initialize the registry with the baseline terms defined in
   this document's core taxonomy.  These include:

   *  Core Data Types: temperatureReading, locationCoordinate,
      audioRecording, videoStream, deviceIdentifier, userPreference,
      biometricData, healthData, presenceIndicator

   *  Core Purposes: coreFunctionality, security, personalization,
      analytics, advertising, diagnostics, regulatoryCompliance

   *  Core Actions: collection, usage, transfer, retention, deletion

   *  Core Sources: sensor, userInput, thirdPartyImport, derivedData

   *  Core Destinations: localProcessing, cloudStorage,
      manufacturerServer, thirdPartyPartner, dataBroker

   Each of these SHALL be registered with complete metadata as described
   above.

8.5.  Registry Management

   The registry SHALL be maintained under the “Expert Review” policy
   defined in [RFC8126].  The designated expert(s) will evaluate
   submissions for:

   *  Conformance with the OWL-DL ontology

   *  Semantic clarity and non-ambiguity

   *  Necessity and non-duplication

   *  Privacy and security impact (if applicable)

   The review process MUST include a public comment period and the
   ability to appeal decisions.

8.5.1.  Extension Mechanism

   To support innovation and domain-specific specialization, the
   taxonomy MUST allow third parties to register custom terms via a
   controlled submission process.

8.5.1.1.  Extension Requirements

   An extension submission MUST:

   *  Declare a unique namespace (e.g., vendorX:, industryGroupY:).

   *  Clearly define its relationship to existing concepts (e.g.,
      subClassOf, equivalentClass).

   *  Include all required registry fields (as above).

   *  Demonstrate necessity: why existing terms are insufficient.

   *  Include privacy risk assessment if the term introduces sensitive
      or novel data practices.

8.5.1.2.  Extension and Deprecation Policy

   Extensions: Entities MAY submit new terms with a custom namespace
   (e.g., vendorX:) as long as relationships to core terms (e.g.,
   subClassOf) are clearly declared.

   Deprecation: Deprecated terms remain in the registry with status
   marked as deprecated.  These terms MUST NOT be used in future policy
   declarations but MAY be preserved for historical validation.

8.5.2.  Access Methods

   The registry SHALL be made publicly available via:

   *  A web-accessible HTML directory with search and browse
      capabilities

   *  A machine-readable API for tool and device integration

   *  Regular snapshots for offline validation
